=============================
A Google Play Services native extension for Haxe NME
-----------------------------

This NME native extension allows you to integrate the Google Play Services into your OpenFL application.

For now it's Android only.
iOS will be coming soom.

Requirement
------------
Require OpenFL 1.1+

Android
-------

Add the following line inside of your project file:
```xml
<!-- Google Play Services ID -->
<setenv name="GooglePlayID" value="REPLACE_ME_WITH_YOUR_GOOGLEID" />
```
This library is using Fragments, so you need to edit your OpenFL template class ( GameActivity.java )

Go into [haxelib folder]/lib/openfl-native/[version]/templates/android/template/src/org/haxe/nme.

And edit the "GameActivity" file. Replace the following line:
```java
public class GameActivity extends Activity implements SensorEventListener {
```
by:
```java
public class GameActivity extends android.support.v4.app.FragmentActivity implements SensorEventListener {
```

Recompiling
-----------
For recompiling the native extensions just use the sh files contained in the project folder
